# PracticeDemos
Some practices when I learn Android, different technical aspects are separated into different part. These practices are just personnal drafts, so there are few comments in the codes.

### Included aspects: ###
```
  - Fragment
  - Service
  - Notification
  - AsynTask
  - Handler 
  - Customized view
  - Animation
  - BaseAdapter
  - ViewPager
  - DrawerLayout
  - Customized ScrollView (that has an spring back effect like those in iOS)
```
